In order to run this code outside of Joey's PC:
1. Change the full path of the images in functions: set_ransomeware_image, reset_picture.
2. Run as admin.
3. Find the localhost full path to the desktop background and copy it to the reset_picture function.
4. To encrypt, cd to the exe directory then do ransomeware.exe -e --folder "path folder"
5. to decrypt switch -d instead of -e

# Dont run the code on the path the code is running or you'll not be able to decrypt your files.
# The Try directory and the example.txt file attached to this file directory is for experiment the code on.
# if you run the exe you dont need to install python at all
